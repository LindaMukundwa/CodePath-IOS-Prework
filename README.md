## Notes

Challenges faced:

- Connecting app to GitHub
- Working on the different iOS options and XCode

Favorite Apps:

1. Pinterest

   - personalized recommendations

3. TikTok
   - infinite scroll
   - ability for anyone to end up on for you page

5. YouTube
   - upload videos and watch synchronously 
   - ability to like videos, or put for watch later

7. Duolingo
   - games to learn languages
   - streak to keep determination

9. Quizlet
   - different modes offered to study
   - progress bar for root memorization

An app I would like to create:

AI integrated app to help diaspora learn dying languages such as Kinyarwanda for the Rwandan community since it is not offered on conventional apps like Duolingo. Some features that I would like to implement is a voice assistance to make sure the accent is correct, context sitations to help simulate learning with people, resources to learn the cultural side of the language as well as a game-style way of learning as seen in other language learning app models. I think it would be beneficial for so many diaspora who want to learn but don't have access to.
